# SuccesserSandbox

This is the Successer Robotics informal git repository.

How to use this repository:

The goal is for different users to be able to create independent changes and then commit them to the main branch. 

Creating a branch:
In order to make changes without changing other peoples work, everyone will make their own separate branch when they want to make edits. To do this, go to the upper left corner of the repository and hit the branch button (it should be automatically set the main branch, which is where we will commit changes later). Here you can create a new branch, which is effectively a copy of what is currently in the main branch. This new branch (whatever you chose to name it) will be what you edit and make your personal changes to.

Committing changes: 
Going into a file and clicking the pencil icon the upper right corner means you can edit that file, and this is how you can make changes inside github on your browser. Once you make changes (in your specific branch), you will want to commit these changes. There is a green button to commit the changes to your branch. 

Updating branches:
Once this process is complete, the only left to do is actually merge your branch back with main so other people can see or approve of your changes. To do this, there is a process known as a pull request. This can be done with an operation known as a pull request. A pull request shows other collaborators the changes you made to your branch and allows them to approve whether or not those changes can be applied to other branches such as their specific ones or main. This process is done so that everyone is on the same page with the changes you made and everyone is in the loop before your changes are merged.

Merging with main:
Once discussing with your pull request, you can then merge your branch with the main branch by going to the 'merge pull request' tab at the top of your page and clicking the confirm button once in that tab. Once confirmed, your branch will be updated to the main branch, and then you are done!

Now, this whole process takes place on github, but there are still ways to edit your code in an IDE of your choice and then add them to github. This requires using the linux terminal or the github desktop app in order to connect your code back to the browser version which everyone can access. In order to do this, talk to Christian and he will help you talk through the best method for you and your computer.
